only ones i had backed up images from (not article sadly, may be in archive.org tho) are put in /mybkups/.
the archive.org links have more & have articles backed up and they will be in this folders /archive.org/ folder.

all nlab.itmedia.co.jp articles about games(?) atleast wii were wiped by them for some reason..

but i saved images from  some of them and also someone archived them on archive.or (?):
(archive.org: hd images may not be possible depending if clicking the image shows the higher quality version or not, i thank whoever went through and archived all these pages or these articles would bee lost..even tho some prob still are but.. )
[[[[this notice was kinda rushed, soo dont be suprised if there is repeated links]]]]
