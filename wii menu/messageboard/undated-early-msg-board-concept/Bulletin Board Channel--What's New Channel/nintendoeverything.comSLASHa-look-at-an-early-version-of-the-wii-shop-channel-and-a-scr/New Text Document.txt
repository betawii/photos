This was never an actual channel, this was just a concept design before
they decided to combine it into the wii menu, date is unknown and predated the Wii Message Board.

unlike the shopping channel, ther is no date for the photos and the code doesnt exist or hasnt been found 
unlike the shop channel that the code was found for :D
